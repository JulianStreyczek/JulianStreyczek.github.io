I made a little [Julia](https://julialang.org/) replication of [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.red.2020.11.004) that compares the effectiveness of government policies in a pandemic in a theoretical model. If you like, have a look at the [Github repo](https://github.com/JulianStreyczek/HammerScalpel.jl) and the [documentation](https://julianstreyczek.github.io/HammerScalpel.jl/dev/)! :floppy_disk:
